# InsightLens

**InsightLens** is a dual-pipeline deep learning tool designed to audit social media content. It analyzes image aesthetics and caption engagement potential to provide creators with a pre-publish quality check.

## Key Features
- **Visual Audit:** specific analysis of image technical quality (sharpness, exposure, composition) using **MobileNetV2**.
- **Caption Audit:** specific analysis of text engagement potential using a **Bidirectional LSTM**.
- **Full-Stack Deployment:** Served via **FastAPI** with a vanilla JS/CSS frontend for zero-dependency usage.

## System Architecture
InsightLens does **not** use a multimodal approach (like CLIP). Instead, it uses a decoupled architecture to evaluate visual and textual signals independently.

### 1. Vision Module (InsightLens-Vision)
- **Model:** MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning).
- **Training Data:** KonIQ-10k (10,000 images with human quality ratings).
- **Target:** Regresses a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) normalized to 0-100.
- **Focus:** It judges *technical aesthetics*, not content context. (e.g., A high-quality photo of a wall scores higher than a blurry photo of a celebrity).

### 2. Text Module (InsightLens-Text)
- **Model:** Embedding Layer + Bidirectional LSTM.
- **Training Data:** Twitter Engagement Dataset (~120k tweets).
- **Target:** Classification (Low/Average/High Engagement) based on 'Like' counts.
- **Focus:** It judges *lexical patterns* associated with high engagement, not semantic coherence with the image.

## Important Limitations
* **No Contextual Awareness:** The system does not know if the caption matches the image. A picture of a cat with the caption "Nice car" will be scored purely on the photo quality of the cat and the engagement history of the words "Nice car".
* **Twitter Bias:** The text model is trained on Twitter data. It prioritizes "Like-getting" patterns (short, punchy text) over "Comment-getting" patterns (questions).
* **Subjectivity:** "Quality" is subjective. The Image model predicts the average human opinion (MOS), which may not align with specific artistic styles.

## Datasets Used
### KonIQ-10k – Image Quality (CV)
**Contains:**
  10,073 natural images
  Human-rated aesthetic/quality scores (MOS)
  Large diversity in lighting, noise, composition
**Purpose in this project:**
  Train a model to estimate aesthetic quality in a way that aligns with human judgment.

### Twitter Engagement Dataset – Caption Quality (NLP)
**Contains:**
Captions/tweets
Associated engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies)
**Used to derive:**
Low, Medium, or High engagement classes
based on percentile thresholds.
**Purpose in this project:**
  Teach the model to understand textual patterns that correlate with user engagement.

### NOTE: InsightLens currently evaluates visual aesthetic quality and textual engagement potential as separate modules. In future work, these could be fused for deeper content quality analysis.
